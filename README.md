# social_network_api

## Overview
This project implements a NoSQL social network API using Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It provides routes and models for managing users, thoughts, and reactions within a social network platform. This API allows users to perform various actions such as creating, updating, and deleting users, thoughts, and reactions, as well as adding and removing friends from their friend list.

## Features
User Management: Create, read, update, and delete user accounts. Users can also add and remove friends from their friend list.

Thought Management: Create, read, update, and delete thoughts. Users can react to thoughts by adding or removing reactions.

NoSQL Database: Utilizes MongoDB as the database for storing user data, thought data, and reaction data.

Robust API: Implements RESTful API routes for seamless interaction with the database.

## Technologies Used
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model application data.
